# CodeRun Solutions

This is the largest archive of solutions to problems from the CodeRun website that I could find on GitHub. All tasks are personally solved by me, so if you have any questions, feel free to submit an issue or contact me directly on Telegram at t.me/Mellodizzz.

To find the solution to a specific task, use the repository's search function. I recommend searching by the task's name (you can find the name in the task's URL) because task numbers may vary depending on the directory you are looking in. However, each task is also numbered with its unique identifier.

In the future, I may add hints and other personal notes. Good luck!
